- Provides user’s privacy by managing permissions guarantee preventing unauthorized access.
- Provides high availability of information as it is stored in Block Chain which is can be accessed remotely.
- Information is organized in a time-variant and non-volatile way.
- Enables diseases prediction according to user entered symptoms.
- Allows users to monitor other users' accounts for special cases.
- Allows users to share records with medical staff or other users.
