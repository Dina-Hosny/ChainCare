## Features

This system provides a whole medical history of the patient since the subscribing to it, also a professional history for doctors and lab doctors. The generated data are stored automatically in electronic records forms ledgers by a blockchain platform which makes it secured and well managed. The users will be able to leverage their medical data to power many applications and services.


- Critical information is stored significantly in End-to-End encrypted records using BlockChain -Ethereum- that makes it difficult or impossible to change, or hack.
- Provides user’s privacy by managing permissions guarantee preventing unauthorized access.
- Provides high availability of information as it is stored in Block Chain which is can be accessed remotely.
- Information is organized in a time-variant and non-volatile way.
- Enables disease prediction according to the user's entered symptoms.
- Allows users to monitor other users' accounts for special cases.
- Allows users to share records with medical staff or other users.
- The system's admin can provide analytical reports and statics for a specific number of medical records.
- The system's admin can add medical staff and Assign patients to specific doctors.
- The system's admin can monitor the medical staff's activities.
- Doctors can provide full professional history for them.
- Doctors can provide an overview of the patient’s situation.
- Lab staff can allow remotely receiving required medical tests and uploading the results.
